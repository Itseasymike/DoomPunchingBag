# Doom Punching Bag

## About

In this DOOM remake our hero :godmode: finds himself in the pits of hell with nothing to protect him but his God-given strength. As our hero tries to escape hell and defeat countless demons along the way, he is faced with one of his deadliest enemies, The Baron of Hell. Our hero must now use nothing but his fists to defeat his enemy and finally escape the demons that wish to destroy him and hell itself.

## Rules

* Click on the "PUNCH!" buttons or use your handy-dandy "left" and "right" arrow keys for maximum punching performance!
* Fight the Baron of Hell til he's mush!
* Don't wait too long though or the Baron wil kill you instantly! :japanese_goblin:
* FISTS ONLY! :facepunch:

## The Process

From the get go, I planned on making a fairly simple game which would include the movement of images and the change of images on the game screen upon certain conditions being met.

### Pseudocode
```
THE MINIMAL VIABLE PRODUCT

In the simplest way my game requires variables that store, enemyHealth = 150 damageDeltByUser = 10

Upon every click of the "PUNCH!" button or keydown of the "left" or "right" arrow keys, the enemys' health will decrease by 10

Decrease the enemyHealth to 0 to win the game

Throughout the fight, if enemyHealth = 'a certain number' change EnemyImage to a more beaten down version of itself

If you take longer than 10 seconds to depleat the enemy's health to 0 and the enemy will deal you a "One Hit Kill", resulting in a loss
```

### Challanges
Working with the time contraints given I wasnt able to implement other attack features for the enemy other than the one-hit-kill option.
